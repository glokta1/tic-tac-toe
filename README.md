A Pygame implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe.

A little practice project to get my feet wet with Pygame.

## How to run
1. Clone the repository

    `git clone asdas`

2. Install poetry for package management

    `pip install poetry`

3. `cd` into project root and run:

    `poetry install`

    to install all dependences.

4. `python main.py`
